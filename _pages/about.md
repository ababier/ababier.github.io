I completed my PhD in operations research at the University of Toronto and now work as a Senior Applied Research Scientist in the Advanced Technology Group at ServiceNow.

My research interests broadly cover computational models that provide actionable insights for new contexts. These interests have led to me to combine predictive and prescriptive analytics to address real world problems. Specifically, I have focused my attention on computer vision and combinatorial optimization, which has helped me develop tools for personalized medicine in radiotherapy to treat complex cancers.
